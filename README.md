### Implementation
*This was implemented entirely by prompting a local LLM (Qwen2.5 Coder 32B Instruct MLX 4-bit) running on my M4 Max 48GB Macbook Pro.  Total time was maybe an hour.*  This implementation only runs a single level, has a fixed screen size, and other limtations

### Trouble Areas
Maybe none?  The first prompt pretty much generated something usable.  That could definitely be due to it being such a popular example project in the past.  However, it was pretty complete right away.
